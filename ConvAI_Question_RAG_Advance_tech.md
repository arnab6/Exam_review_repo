Agentic chunking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refers to an adaptive, context-aware method of segmenting information into meaningful chunks for retrieval and generation. Unlike static chunking strategies (e.g., fixed-size or sentence-based), agentic chunking dynamically adjusts chunk sizes and boundaries based on the query context, semantic coherence, and relevance to improve retrieval efficiency and response quality.

This approach allows RAG systems to optimize how documents or knowledge sources are broken down for retrieval, ensuring that each chunk carries enough meaningful context without unnecessary noise. This is particularly useful for long-form documents, structured data retrieval, and knowledge-intensive tasks where retrieving highly relevant information matters.

Key aspects of agentic chunking include:

- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Chunks are created based on query intent rather than predefined fixed sizes.
- **Semantic Coherence**: Ensuring that retrieved chunks maintain logical meaning and relevance.
- **Hierarchical Chunking**: Some implementations allow multi-level chunking (e.g., paragraphs, sections, sub-sections) to optimize retrieval.
- **Efficiency in Retrieval**: Reduces unnecessary retrieval of irrelevant data while improving precision.

**Agentic Chunking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

**What Is Agentic Chunking?**

**Agentic chunking** is an LLM-in-the-loop chunking strategy that uses a language model as an “agent” to intelligently segment text, mimicking how a human reader might partition a document ([Chunking strategies for RAG tutorial using Granite | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/tutorials/chunking-strategies-for-rag-with-langchain-watsonx-ai#:~:text=,reasoning%20when%20processing%20long%20documents)) ([Mastering Chunking in RAG: Techniques and Strategies](https://www.projectpro.io/article/chunking-in-rag/1024#:~:text=Agentic%20Chunking%20is%20an%20experimental,like%20understanding%20is%20beneficial)). Instead of blindly splitting by length or simple rules, the LLM analyzes the content and decides where **natural breakpoints** should be, based on meaning, topic transitions, and document structure ([8 Types of Chunking for RAG Systems - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/types-of-chunking-for-rag-systems/#:~:text=Agentic%20chunking%20is%20an%20advanced,paragraph%20breaks%20and%20topic%20transitions)). In other words, the chunking process itself becomes a task for an AI agent, making decisions about chunk boundaries in a context-aware manner ([8 Types of Chunking for RAG Systems - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/types-of-chunking-for-rag-systems/#:~:text=By%20using%20AI%20to%20determine,driven%20text%20segments)).

Unlike fixed or static chunkers, an agentic chunker doesn’t have a one-size rule for all text. It “reads” through the document and segments it dynamically, ensuring each chunk is a semantically coherent unit (much like a person would outline or summarize a text) ([8 Types of Chunking for RAG Systems - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/types-of-chunking-for-rag-systems/#:~:text=By%20using%20AI%20to%20determine,driven%20text%20segments)). This approach aims to **preserve context and meaning** within each chunk, avoiding splits that cut off an explanation or leave dangling references. As one source describes, agentic chunking tries to do chunking *“as any human would do”*, by starting at the beginning of a document and deciding chunk boundaries on the fly whenever the topic or context shifts ([Agentic Splitting: Our novel approach to chunking | Zango - Transform compliance into actions 10x quicker with Zango AI](https://www.zango.ai/blog-post/agnetic-splitting-our-novel-approach-to-chunking#:~:text=,create%20a%20new%20one%20%E2%80%8D)). Essentially, the LLM is given the role of a content analyst, determining how best to break the text into self-contained sections.

**How it works:** There are a few ways to implement agentic chunking, but a common workflow is:

1. *Pre-split into micro segments:* The document may first be divided into very small pieces (e.g. by sentence or every N characters) to serve as initial units. This ensures the LLM can handle the input in stages and not miss any part. For example, splitting into “mini-chunks” of ~300 characters that respect sentence boundaries ([Agentic Chunking: Enhancing RAG Answers for Completeness and Accuracy](https://alhena.ai/blog/agentic-chunking-enhancing-rag-answers-for-completeness-and-accuracy/#:~:text=1.%20Mini,an%20LLM%20along%20with%20specific)).
1. *LLM decides chunk grouping or breakpoints:* The LLM is prompted to analyze these mini-segments and either group them into larger chunks or identify where a new chunk should start. One approach is to have the LLM consider a window of text (up to a max chunk size) and return the best position to break (a breakpoint) before meaning is lost ([8 Types of Chunking for RAG Systems - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/types-of-chunking-for-rag-systems/#:~:text=Talking%20about%20the%20LLM,that%E2%80%99s%20more%20meaningful%20and%20coherent)) ([8 Types of Chunking for RAG Systems - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/types-of-chunking-for-rag-systems/#:~:text=while%20remaining_text%3A%20,where%20to%20break%20the%20text)). Another approach is to feed the LLM the sequence of mini-chunks (possibly annotated or numbered) along with instructions to group them into cohesive sections ([Agentic Chunking: Enhancing RAG Answers for Completeness and Accuracy](https://alhena.ai/blog/agentic-chunking-enhancing-rag-answers-for-completeness-and-accuracy/#:~:text=3.%20LLM,each%20chunk%2C%20such%20as%20source)). In both cases, the LLM uses its understanding of the content to propose logical chunk divisions – e.g. ensuring that a definition stays with its explanation, or that subsequent sentences that refer to a previous one remain in the same chunk.
1. *Assemble final chunks:* Based on the LLM’s decisions, the system combines the text into final chunk units. Overlap can be added as needed (often including a bit of the next or previous mini-chunk in each chunk for context continuity) ([Agentic Chunking: Enhancing RAG Answers for Completeness and Accuracy](https://alhena.ai/blog/agentic-chunking-enhancing-rag-answers-for-completeness-and-accuracy/#:~:text=selected%20by%20the%20LLM,process%20them%20in%20manageable%20parts)). Metadata like section titles or chunk indices might be attached at this stage for traceability ([Agentic Chunking: Enhancing RAG Answers for Completeness and Accuracy](https://alhena.ai/blog/agentic-chunking-enhancing-rag-answers-for-completeness-and-accuracy/#:~:text=,Include%20the%20previous%20and%2For%20next)).
1. *Validation and fallback:* Because this process relies on an LLM (which could err or vary), practical implementations include guardrails ([Agentic Chunking: Enhancing RAG Answers for Completeness and Accuracy](https://alhena.ai/blog/agentic-chunking-enhancing-rag-answers-for-completeness-and-accuracy/#:~:text=6,threading%20for%20faster%20processing)). For instance, enforce a maximum chunk size (never exceed the LLM context limit), ensure no text is lost (all mini-chunks are accounted for), and if the LLM fails to provide an answer (or returns an invalid breakpoint), fall back to a simpler splitting rule ([Agentic Chunking: Enhancing RAG Answers for Completeness and Accuracy](https://alhena.ai/blog/agentic-chunking-enhancing-rag-answers-for-completeness-and-accuracy/#:~:text=window%2C%20split%20and%20process%20them,threading%20for%20faster%20processing)). This makes the approach robust in production.


1. **SLM-Based Re-Ranking of Retrieved Chunks** – Where a small language model (SLM) is used to refine or re-rank retrieved documents before passing them to a larger model.
1. **Agentic Generation** – Where the generation process is dynamically controlled by an LLM to optimize responses.
1. **SLM-Based Answer Selection** – Where an SLM is used to choose the best answer from multiple LLM-generated responses.

**1. SLM-Based Re-Ranking of Retrieved Chunks**

Retrieval-augmented systems often use a **two-stage retrieval** pipeline: a fast first-stage retriever (e.g. embeddings or BM25) gets a pool of candidate text chunks, then a **small language model (SLM)** re-ranks those chunks for relevance before the final answer is generated. This SLM (often a fine-tuned cross-encoder or smaller LLM) scores each candidate’s relevance to the query, ensuring the larger LLM sees only the most pertinent context. For example, NVIDIA’s NeMo RAG pipeline uses a LoRA-fine-tuned Mistral-7B (truncated to 16 layers) as a reranker to filter and reorder retrieved passages ([Enhancing RAG Pipelines with Re-Ranking | NVIDIA Technical Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-rag-pipelines-with-re-ranking/#:~:text=In%20this%20post%2C%20I%20use,tuned%20for%20the%20ranking%20task)) ([Enhancing RAG Pipelines with Re-Ranking | NVIDIA Technical Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-rag-pipelines-with-re-ranking/#:~:text=Add%20a%20re)). This reranker assigns high relevance scores to passages that likely contain the answer, and only those top-ranked chunks are passed to the big LLM. Similarly, open-source frameworks like LlamaIndex and Haystack advocate **SLM-based re-ranking**: first retrieve top-*k* via embeddings, then use a smaller model (e.g. a BERT or MiniLM cross-encoder) to re-evaluate and pick the best subset ([Using LLM’s for Retrieval and Reranking — LlamaIndex - Build Knowledge Assistants over your Enterprise Data](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/using-llms-for-retrieval-and-reranking-23cf2d3a14b6#:~:text=LlamaIndex%20around%20LLM,based%20lookup)). Cohere’s **Rerank** model is another real-world example – a dedicated smaller language model that “provides a semantic boost to search quality,” often used in enterprise chatbots and search engines to improve RAG results ([Enhancing RAG Pipelines with Re-Ranking | NVIDIA Technical Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-rag-pipelines-with-re-ranking/#:~:text=In%20this%20post%2C%20I%20use,tuned%20for%20the%20ranking%20task)). By integrating SLM rerankers, companies across industries (from customer support knowledge bases to legal document search) report more accurate answers, since the large GPT-style model gets highly relevant context and fewer off-target distractors. In practice, using an SLM reranker in RAG can **reduce hallucinations** and improve answer precision by reordering documents to prioritize the most relevant ones ([Mastering RAG: How to Select A Reranking Model - Galileo AI](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/mastering-rag-how-to-select-a-reranking-model#:~:text=ImageImage)) ([Enhancing RAG Pipelines with Re-Ranking | NVIDIA Technical Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-rag-pipelines-with-re-ranking/#:~:text=Add%20a%20re)). This approach has been implemented in domains like finance (to pinpoint the most relevant financial report snippets for an analysis query) and healthcare (e.g. re-ranking patient notes to find the crucial facts for a diagnosis). Overall, SLM-powered re-ranking has become a **best practice** for advanced RAG systems to boost retrieval precision before generation ([Using LLM’s for Retrieval and Reranking — LlamaIndex - Build Knowledge Assistants over your Enterprise Data](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/using-llms-for-retrieval-and-reranking-23cf2d3a14b6#:~:text=LlamaIndex%20around%20LLM,based%20lookup)) ([Enhancing RAG Pipelines with Re-Ranking | NVIDIA Technical Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/enhancing-rag-pipelines-with-re-ranking/#:~:text=In%20this%20post%2C%20I%20use,tuned%20for%20the%20ranking%20task)).

**2. Agentic Generation**

“Agentic generation” refers to letting the LLM itself **dynamically control the retrieval and writing process** – the model acts as an *agent* that plans, calls tools, or iteratively refines its output for better coherence. Instead of a single pass answer, the LLM might break a complex query into sub-questions, fetch info in multiple steps, and reason about it, much like a human researcher. This is realized through frameworks like **ReAct (Reason+Act)** agents and multi-step RAG techniques. For instance, Microsoft’s **CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation)** is a recent agentic RAG approach that allows an LLM to perform iterative search and reasoning ([Microsoft Introduces CoRAG: Enhancing AI Retrieval with Iterative Reasoning - InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/02/corag-microsoft-ai/#:~:text=Microsoft%20AI%2C%20in%20collaboration%20with,retrievals%20dynamically%20before%20generating%20answers)). CoRAG reformulates queries based on intermediate results – the model “thinks through” what to search next – enabling integration of information from multiple sources for a more complete answer ([Microsoft Introduces CoRAG: Enhancing AI Retrieval with Iterative Reasoning - InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/02/corag-microsoft-ai/#:~:text=enables%20iterative%20search%20and%20reasoning%2C,retrievals%20dynamically%20before%20generating%20answers)) ([Microsoft Introduces CoRAG: Enhancing AI Retrieval with Iterative Reasoning - InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/02/corag-microsoft-ai/#:~:text=much%20like%20human%20researchers)). In practice, this means an LLM might retrieve some facts, realize a piece is missing, then automatically issue a follow-up query, retrieve again, and only then produce a final answer. Agentic generation techniques greatly help on **multi-hop questions** or when information is scattered: the LLM plans a strategy (e.g. *find A, then find B, then compare*) rather than relying on one shot retrieval. Industry blogs highlight that **Agentic RAG** adds layers like routing, tool use, and adaptive reasoning on top of base RAG ([Unlocking the Power of Agentic RAG — Engineering Business Outcomes | Infogain](https://www.infogain.com/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-agentic-rag/#:~:text=Agentic%20RAG%20revolutionizes%20the%20way,tackle%20complex%20questions%20that%20require)). These agents can browse multiple documents, call external tools/APIs, and even self-check the answer for completeness. For example, an “Agentic RAG” assistant in enterprise support could detect that a user’s question actually has two parts, then autonomously query the internal knowledge base twice (once for each part) and compose a unified answer. Infogain engineering notes that agent-based RAG handles intricate planning, multi-step reasoning, and tool usage, acting *“like a team of expert researchers…navigating multiple documents, comparing information, generating summaries”* to deliver accurate results ([Unlocking the Power of Agentic RAG — Engineering Business Outcomes | Infogain](https://www.infogain.com/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-agentic-rag/#:~:text=%2A%20Intricate%20planning%20%2A%20Multi,Utilization%20of%20external%20tools)) ([Unlocking the Power of Agentic RAG — Engineering Business Outcomes | Infogain](https://www.infogain.com/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-agentic-rag/#:~:text=Image%20These%20agents%20act%20like,task%20with%20precision%20and%20efficiency)). Real-world implementations include customer service bots that use an LLM agent to decide when to ask clarifying questions or pull in additional customer data, and legal AI assistants that iterate over statutes and case law in steps to build a well-supported answer. By giving LLMs this **dynamic control** – deciding which actions to take (retrieve, summarize, calculate, etc.) and in what sequence – agentic generation yields more **contextually coherent and thorough** responses than static one-shot generation.

**3. SLM-Based Answer Selection**

Another advanced technique is using a **small language model to select the best answer** from multiple candidate responses generated by LLMs. In a RAG setup, one might prompt an LLM to produce several answer drafts (e.g. using different retrieved contexts or varying reasoning paths) and then employ a smaller model to evaluate which answer is most correct or relevant. This approach introduces a feedback loop: the SLM “judge” ranks outputs, ensuring the final response meets quality standards (factual accuracy, completeness, etc.). For example, researchers have proposed ensemble methods like **InfoSel (Information Selection)**, which trains a lightweight model (e.g. a 110M-param BERT) to pick the best answer among those given by multiple black-box LLMs () (). InfoSel treats each LLM’s answer as an option in a multi-choice problem and learns to predict which option is best, using question and context features (). In tests on Q&A tasks, this SLM-based selector outperformed naive strategies like majority vote, effectively boosting accuracy by leveraging the diversity of an ensemble (). Another example is the **HGOT framework** (Hierarchical Graph-of-Thought), which generates multiple “thought” chains and candidate answers, then applies a self-consistency voting mechanism (using citation precision/recall as signals) to choose the final answer ([Aman's AI Journal • NLP • Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/RAG/#:~:text=,employs%20a%20scoring%20mechanism%20for)). By quantitatively evaluating each candidate’s supporting evidence, the system ensures the selected answer is well-supported by retrieved sources. In industry, we see similar ideas: for instance, a customer support AI might generate two possible replies to a complicated query and then use a smaller QA model to compare each reply against the knowledge base, selecting the one with the correct solution (this minimizes the chance of giving incorrect info to customers). Likewise, safety-critical applications (legal or medical assistants) could deploy a secondary SLM to double-check and **select answers** that are consistent with provided references. Even RLHF-trained LLM services implicitly do a form of answer selection – during training, a smaller **reward model** ranks multiple outputs to guide the LLM – and some production systems run an extra **evaluation model** to pick the highest-quality response if an LLM generates several drafts. Overall, SLM-based answer selection adds an **extra layer of validation** in RAG: by aggregating multiple generative attempts and letting a focused smaller model (or algorithm) choose the best, it can significantly improve reliability ([Aman's AI Journal • NLP • Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/RAG/#:~:text=,employs%20a%20scoring%20mechanism%20for)). This technique is being explored in research papers and deployments to maximize answer quality, ensuring that users get the most relevant and correct answer out of many possible generations.
